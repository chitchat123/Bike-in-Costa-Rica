            -Because we have many groups, and everything is already prepared and working!<br>
            -Because as we said before, this is mostly our passion!<br>
            -And because one of our concerns is helping the regions we cross, and the little business we work with, and we know each group means a lot for them!<br>
          </p>

        <br><br>
        <p>
          These are our regular benefits and prices. Discounts or supplements can apply according to final number of bikers, dates of registration, dates of the tour... Don’t hesitate to ask!<br><br>

          Lodging included is basic, but groups always tell us it is good enough. We will send you the details according to each group. Also, we will send you more options in case you want to upgrade or choose a different lodging...<br><br>

          Lunch and dinner are not included in most groups. This way, you can choose exactly what you want to eat.<br><br>

          Also, we can take care of:<br><br>

          -Nights in San Jose. Depending on the lodging each group prefers, and the number arrival and departure. From $20 to $80/person/night.<br><br>

          -Bike rent. Let us know if you want to rent and we will send you the options... $20 to $60/bike/day.<br>

           We can also help you with every other activity you would like to do. We will not take care of them, but we can advise you, and then you can book by your self.<br><br>

        <h1 id="more" class="title">How to book - Questions</h1>
        <p>
          First step is to send us an email with the itinerary you want, the approximate dates, the number of days biking, the number of people... and every other thing you consider important.<br><br>

          In very short time we will send you a proposal.<br><br>

          We will probably exchange some more emails... adjusting the ride, the lodging, the nights in San Jose... Till we get your perfect program!<br><br>

          When you say it is ok, your group will be confirmed...<br><br>

          We will make the local bookings...<br><br>
